        <p>The outcome of the 2020 census in Detroit will determine the success of our city for the next 10 years. <br /><br />In 2010, it’s estimated that roughly 27,000 households did not complete the census, depriving Detroit of crucial funding. We can’t afford to make the same mistake twice.</p>

        <h3>WORRIED ABOUT THE "CITIZENSHIP QUESTION?"</h3><br /><small>A southern District of New York federal judge ruled that the addition of a citizenship question in the 2020 Census questionnaire violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which prohibits federal agencies from acting in a manner that is arbitrary and capricious or not in accordance with law. The administration is expected to appeal the ruling to the Second Circuit, and the case will likely be fast-tracked to the Supreme Court. A final ruling from the highest court is anticipated before the final questionnaires are printed, beginning in June 2019. While it remains uncertain how the case will fare in the appellate system, the first ruling documented a strong case against the question’s addition.</small>
